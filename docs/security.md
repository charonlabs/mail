# Security

Recommendations
- Use HTTPS for all deployments and registry communications
- Separate tokens and roles for users, admins, and agents
- Require admin role for registry mutations and loading swarms
- Use environment variable references for persistent interswarm auth tokens
- Apply rate limiting at HTTP ingress if public facing
- Restrict tool execution; validate parameters and avoid dangerous side effects

Auth integration
- The server delegates token validation to `TOKEN_INFO_ENDPOINT`
- Expected shape: `{ role: "admin"|"user"|"agent", id: string, api_key: string }`
- Internal user token is derived as `{role}_{id}` and used for per-user MAIL instances

Operational
- Keep `SWARM_REGISTRY_FILE` on secure storage and ensure only env-var references are persisted
- Rotate environment variables instead of editing persisted JSON
- Monitor logs for interswarm health changes and failures
