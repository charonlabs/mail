# Example
A MAIL swarm `example` has agents `supervisor` and `wra`.
`supervisor` can interact with the user and complete the task, while `wra` can call the actions `start_web_research` and `fetch_web_research`.
Say a user creates a task to start web research on the topic of "effect of climate change by 2050":

```xml

From there, `wra` can call `start_web_research` to begin the research process for the user's query.
However, this task is taking too long to complete--perhaps due to API issues.

    <body>The web research process is taking too long to complete. Can you check on the status?</body>

```

`supervisor` can then call the `send_interrupt` tool to interrupt `wra`:

```xml
<message>
    <sender type="agent">supervisor</sender>
    <recipient type="agent">wra</recipient>

The agent can then notify `supervisor` of the status of the research process:

```xml

`supervisor` can then delegate specific tasks to `weather` and `wra` before preparing a final response.
`weather` and `wra` may communicate with each other directly, not just through `supervisor`.
However, `weather` does not seem to be working properly--it's unable to process `supervisor`'s messages.
Upon seeing this, `supervisor` sends a broadcast to `wra` to inform it of the issue:

```xml
<message>
    <sender type="agent">supervisor</sender>
    <recipients>
        <recipient type="agent">wra</recipient>
    </recipients>
    <subject>Weather issue</subject>
    <body>The weather agent is not responding to messages. Keep this in mind when preparing the report. I will let you know if there are any updates.</body>
    <msg_type>broadcast</msg_type>
</message>
```

Alternatively, `supervisor` can send a broadcast to all agents in the swarm (including `weather`):

```xml
<message>
    <sender type="agent">supervisor</sender>
    <recipients>
        <recipient type="agent">all</recipient>
    </recipients>
    <subject>Weather issue</subject>
    <body>The weather agent is not responding to messages. Keep this in mind for this task. I will let you know if there are any updates.</body>
    <msg_type>broadcast</msg_type>
</message>
```

Broadcast recipients can then acknowledge the broadcast and continue with their work.
When the user's task is done, `task_complete` is called by `supervisor`.

# Example
A MAIL swarm `example` has agents `supervisor` and `wra`.

```

In this case, `supervisor` has nothing else to do before research is complete.
Since `wra` will receive an '::action_complete_broadcast::' message when the research is complete, `supervisor` can call the `await_message` tool to wait for `wra`'s response:

```python
await_message(reason="Waiting for wra's response.")
```

When `perform_web_research` is complete, `wra` will respond to `supervisor` with the result of the research:

    <body>The result of the web research is as follows. ...</body>
